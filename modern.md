##### Masculinity in Crisis: A Shared Anxiety Across Cultures

Both China and the United States are experiencing what many described as a masculinity crisis, though the causes and responses differ significantly.

In modern China, concerns about masculinity are tied closely to national strength and cultural identity. As the country experiences economic growth and global influence, authorities have grown increasingly worried that modern comforts and cultural shifts are weakening traditional masculinity. The government has responded with aggressive campaigns to “toughen up” boys: banning “effeminate” men from TV, promoting sports in schools, and urging more male role models in education [[Effeminate Men]].

This is part of a broader fear that feminization equals decline. Popular idols like the “little fresh meat” actors challenge the state’s preferred masculine ideal [[Effeminate Men]]— not just by being androgynous, but by attracting admiration from women, signaling a cultural power shift. Yet, as the article notes, this conflict between official masculine ideals and popular preference mirrors earlier Western anxieties, such as Theodore Roosevelt’s promotion of muscular Christianity to combat “softness” in American men during the imperial era [[Modern American Masculinity]].

Meanwhile, in the United States, the masculinity crisis stems less from nationalistic concerns and more from economic and social transformation. Christine Emba describes a generation of men — particularly young men — who feel unmoored and invisible in a world where the old rules for being a man no longer apply, and the new ones are unclear or stigmatized [[Modern American Masculinity]].

##### Where men were once defined as providers and protectors, they now face:

- Declining college and job participation
- Shifting relationship dynamics
- The erosion of the breadwinner model
- Fewer male mentors, especially in childhood and education

These changes have created a vacuum in male identity — one that right-wing figures like Jordan Peterson (read more about him [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Peterson)) and Andrew Tate have been quick to fill. While some of their advice emphasizes discipline and purpose, much of it also veers into misogyny or nostalgia for a more patriarchal past.

In contrast, progressive voices have often been hesitant to tackle male-specific struggles head-on. Emba (from [[Modern American Masculinity]]) argues that this cultural silence has only worsened male alienation — and allowed regressive movements to dominate the conversation.

That question remains central. And it’s not just theoretical — the lack of clear, positive male role models is having real consequences, from depression and loneliness to political radicalization and gender-based resentment.

##### Emotional Suppression and the "Mask" of Manhood

The short documentary *The Mask You Live In* (idk if like italisizing is correct or if quotes is better here) captures the lived reality behind this crisis. It shows how boys in America are taught from a young age that masculinity requires emotional suppression, toughness, and dominance. Vulnerability is seen as weakness; emotional openness, as unmanly [[The Mask You Live In]].

The result is a cycle of emotional isolation, where boys internalize pain, lash out in aggression, or suffer in silence. The phrase “be a man” becomes a cultural straightjacket, shaping not only how boys behave but what they believe about themselves. Several boys in the film speak of feeling suicidal as early as middle school — not due to specific trauma, but simply from the pressure of performing masculinity in a way that denies their basic emotional needs.

This echoes the “hypermasculinity” explored in other research [[30-Day Project]], where toughness becomes a mask — not a trait. And this mask, while socially rewarded, prevents meaningful connection. As one speaker puts it: “You are going to have boys and girls, men and women go crazy.”

##### Modern Masculinity

Despite their different origins, both the Chinese and American crises revolve around a shared question:  
How can men find purpose in a changing world without reverting to harmful ideals?

In China, the state’s response has been to double down on traditional masculinity — focusing on strength, discipline, and national service. This aligns masculinity with power and social order, but risks alienating those who don't fit the mold or who gravitate toward softer expressions of manhood [[Effeminate Men]].

In America, the crisis is more fragmented. Some advocate for reinventing masculinity — grounding it in character, community, and emotional intelligence. Christine Emba suggests a new model that retains traits like strength and leadership, but redefines them in pro-social ways:

- Protection as care, not control
- Leadership as responsibility, not dominance
- Pride in masculinity that includes empathy, mentorship, and purpose

Programs focused on male mentorship (like Boys2Men) are a good start, but cultural messaging still has a long way to go. Without strong public scripts for healthy masculinity, many boys turn to influencers offering clarity — even if it's toxic.

### Effeminate Men

##### Masculinity, Empire, and the Fear of Soft Men

China is now facing a similar a crisis over masculinity like Britain in the 19th century and America in the early 20th. The fear is that economic success and modern comforts are eroding the "manly vigor" needed to defend and expand national power.

This anxiety is manifesting in state-driven cultural campaigns. Chinese authorities have recently banned “effeminate” men from television, blurred earrings and dyed hair on male celebrities, and launched school initiatives aimed at cultivating masculinity. A top political adviser, Si Zefu, has warned that feminization threatens China’s development as boys are “spoiled” and lack strong male role models, particularly in schools dominated by female teachers.

At the center of concern are the so-called “little fresh meat” pop idols — delicate, androgynous young men popular with female audiences. Officials fear these figures are making military or civil service roles unattractive to boys, and even contributing to national decadence. The push to combat “sissiness” has included conspiracy theories, some even saying that it's a CIA plot to feminize Asian men through Japanese pop culture.

This pattern isn’t uniquely Chinese though. The article also draws direct parallels to earlier moments of masculine crisis in the West. Theodore Roosevelt, reacting to the same set of concerns, called for “strenuous living” and military expansion, casting imperialism as a test of manhood. For Roosevelt and others, masculinity was linked to national destiny — and softness, to decline. Even then, changing gender roles and rising female independence had stoked fears that men were losing their dominant role in society.

Movements like Muscular Christianity — promoting physical fitness and toughness through church and youth organizations — emerged in both Britain and America to counter what was perceived as over-civilized, feminized manhood. Theodore Roosevelt himself even grew up in a household practicing muscular christianity. It’s not hard to see the connections of this today in China’s push to get boys into sports, or its growing interest in military-style education.

In all three cases of Britain, America, and now China, a key theme repeats: rapid modernization, social change, and rising female visibility create an atmosphere of masculine insecurity. Yet, the public appetite for softer masculinity (especially among women) complicates the picture. Chinese women’s growing economic and cultural influence helps fuel the popularity of xiao xian rou idols despite the government’s disdain for them. The official vision of masculinity doesn’t necessarily align with what consumers want.

Ultimately, the article suggests that China’s current masculinity panic is not just about cultural taste — it’s about power, legacy, and fear. As the nation attempts to secure its future as a global force, it’s looking to the past for cues — and, like Roosevelt’s America or imperial Britain, it’s choosing to police masculinity in the name of national strength.

### Modern American Masculinity

##### A Crisis of Masculinity in Modern America

The author of this article, Christine Emba, outlines a growing identity crisis among men, particularly young men, who feel increasingly lost in modern society. She states that many are struggling with confusion, lack of direction, and loneliness, with no clear or positive model of masculinity to emulate. This absence has left a vacuum that right-wing influencers have been quick to fill.

One example the article gives is a quote by a student, asking his professor,
> “What the heck does good masculinity look like?” - a college student, quoted in the article

**Economic and Social Displacement**

The traditional model of masculinity — as provider, protector, and patriarch — has become increasingly unviable due to economic and social changes:
- Decline of physical labor and rise of service and knowledge industries
- Decreased college enrollment and employment among young men
- Women surpassing men in educational and economic attainment
- Changing dating and relationship dynamics, with more women choosing independence

> “Men now receive about 74 bachelor’s degrees for every 100 awarded to women.”

This shift has left many men feeling alienated, leading to issues like increased loneliness, mental health crises, and for them to retreat into the "manosphere" (analogous to the hypermasculinity mentioned in [[30-Day Project]]) or online radical spaces.

Also, this finding matches one in the [[Of Boys and Men]] men book where women went from having some 13-15% less bachelor's degrees than men to some 13-15% more bachelor's degrees than men. This number doesn't match the finding in the article likely due to difference in sample times, but the trend still stands. Though I focused on this specific point, pretty much everything here was stated in the book as well.

**A Vacuum in Male Identity**

Modern society lacks a coherent, affirmative model of masculinity:
- Past ideals (strength, stoicism, leadership) are often labeled “toxic." A quick note, I'm not sure where the article gets the leadership is toxic thing from, but I don't think so.
- New models are vague or skew feminine: sensitivity, quietness, deference
- There’s little room to be proudly masculine without being criticized

This once again very well reflects one of the notions in the [[Of Boys and Men]] book. The specific quote I think of is by Richard Reeves in an interview, which I covered in the [[30-Day Project]] contract.

> “I feel like there’s a lot of room to be proudly feminine, but... not the same room to be proudly masculine.” – Ronan Bray, college student

Many men, especially without strong father figures or male mentors, grow up without clear guidance, and public male role models are either rare or polarizing.

**The Right-Wing Response: Structure and Identity**

Figures like Jordan Peterson, Andrew Tate, Josh Hawley, and “Bronze Age Pervert” have capitalized on male confusion by offering:
- Clear guidance and identity rooted in traditional masculinity
- Emphasis on self-discipline, hierarchy, strength, and male purpose
- Validation of male-specific struggles

> “Jordan Peterson taught me how to live.” – anonymous audience member

While some advice is banal or even useful (e.g., “stand up straight”), much of it slides into misogyny, grievance politics, or a regressive vision of male dominance. Also reflective of my findings in my [[30-Day Project]] contract

**The Left’s Hesitation and Oversight**

Progressives have often avoided directly engaging with men’s issues:
- Fear of undermining women’s progress
- Skepticism toward defining masculinity at all
- Tendency to generalize men's struggles as mere symptoms of lost privilege

This avoidance has created a political and cultural gap:
- Support for struggling men is often dismissed or depersonalized
- Political messaging frequently strips out male-specific language

> “If the question is what scripts we have for men... then being willing and able to talk about men is a pretty key component.” – Democratic strategist

**Toward a New Masculinity**

Emba argues that masculinity needs to be affirmed and redefined, not erased. A new model might include:
- Strength and risk-taking, but in pro-social forms
- Protectiveness, leadership, and agency
- Responsibility, especially in relationships and community

> “Real men protect other people.” – Scott Galloway

The new masculinity should be rooted in character, not dominance, and should acknowledge male distinctiveness without pathologizing it.

**Mentorship and Cultural Transmission**

Masculinity, historically, is something passed from men to boys — a process that is breaking down:
- Fatherlessness is rising, especially among boys
- Boys often grow up without male teachers, coaches, or role models
- Programs like Boys2Men and proposals for more male teachers aim to counteract this

> “Masculinity had to be earned — and proved.” – David D. Gilmore, _Manhood in the Making_

Without male mentorship, young men may turn to influencers who offer strong but dangerous messages.

**Conclusion: Masculinity Needs Reinvention, Not Rejection**

The current confusion around masculinity is dangerous if left unaddressed, feeding radicalization and despair. But it also presents an opportunity to build something better:
- Embrace male difference without hostility
- Provide positive scripts and social support
- Use character, community, and empathy as guiding principles

> “The old script for masculinity might be on its way out. It’s time we replaced it with something better.” – Christine Emba

### The Mask You Live In

The short documentary, not an article this time, explores how American boys are conditioned from an early age to suppress vulnerability in the name of “being a man.” The phrase itself — “Be a man” — is identified as one of the most destructive instructions a boy can receive. It signals that emotions, softness, and need are weaknesses, and that masculinity must be constantly proven rather than simply inhabited.

The result is a culture where boys wear emotional masks, described in the video as metaphorical defenses they put on each morning just to get through the day. This masking is especially strong in peer groups, where boys mimic each other’s emotional detachment, even though what they deeply crave is connection and closeness.

Without healthy ways to express feelings, emotional pain turns inward or lashes out: depression misread as aggression, sadness that morphs into violence. Multiple boys in the video speak openly about feeling isolated and suicidal as early as sixth grade. For some, aggression becomes the only “acceptable” form of expression — a way to defend a fragile sense of respect.

This distortion of masculinity stems from a culture that devalues so-called “feminine” traits of care, empathy, emotional literacy. And in such an environment, not only boys but <u>everyone</u> suffers. As one speaker says plainly, “You are going to have boys and girls, men and women go crazy.”

The video ends with a call to end this hypermasculine (similar to hypermasculinity mentioned in [[30-Day Project]]) narrative — to dismantle the notion that equates manhood with silence, stoicism, and dominance.
