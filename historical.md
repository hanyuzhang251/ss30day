### Historical Foundations
##### Traditional Roles and Ideals

**Similarities and Differences in Family Models**

Both traditional Chinese and American family models place men in the role of the authority figure within the household. In both cultures, the man is expected to lead the family, whether through decision-making, provision, or moral guidance.

However, the foundation of that authority differs between the two. In Chinese tradition, this authority is deeply rooted in Confucian ethics, which emphasize hierarchical obedience and a man’s moral duty to guide and protect his family [[Confucian Family Roles]]. A father is seen as a kind but commanding figure, one who earns respect through virtue and seniority. The structure of the family is not just practical but moral — with obligations built on age, lineage, and a deep sense of cultural continuity.

In contrast, American tradition, especially after the 19th century, began to place more weight on a man's ability to provide financially. As industrialization grew, the father’s role shifted from being a religious and moral educator to being the primary breadwinner [[American Fatherhood]]. Economic provision became the central way men defined themselves in the family. This was especially visible in the 20th century when the image of the ideal father was shaped by his ability to earn and support a suburban lifestyle — not necessarily his presence in day-to-day parenting.

**Defining Masculinity Across Cultures**

The definition of masculinity is another key area where these two cultures show both depth and divergence.

In traditional Chinese culture, masculinity is shaped by the dual ideals of wen (scholarly refinement) and wu (martial strength) [[Traditional Chinese Masculinity]]. The ideal man — and by extension, the ideal leader — was expected to exhibit a balance of intellectual wisdom and physical capability. This reflects a more holistic view of masculinity, where strength is important, but so is virtue, restraint, and education. As Kam Louie explains, the ideal emperor was someone who had enough of both traits to command respect, even if he wasn’t a master of either. That balance reminds me of the quote:

"A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one." – often attributed to William Shakespeare
Traditional Chinese views of masculinity emphasize integration over dominance, suggesting that the most “manly” man is the one who can lead both with wisdom and action.

In traditional American culture, masculinity centered more heavily on toughness, stoicism, and breadwinning [[American Masculinity]]. Especially during and after the World Wars, masculinity became tied to the idea of emotional restraint and economic productivity. Being a man meant being unshakable, emotionally distant, and capable of supporting a family no matter the cost to personal well-being. Cultural messages reinforced that real men didn’t complain, didn’t cry, and didn’t depend on anyone. Compared to the Chinese model, this seems more individualistic — and more about maintaining an image of being in control. In some ways, it’s masculinity as performance.

**Reflections on Masculinity and Leadership**

What stands out to me most is how leadership and masculinity are deeply connected in both cultures, but understood in different ways.

In China, the man leads through moral responsibility, harmony, and wisdom — even within a strict hierarchy. Fatherhood is about providing guidance and being a role model, not just financially but spiritually and ethically [[Role of Fathers in China]]. The concept of natal debt — the idea that children owe respect and care to their parents for giving them life — reinforces the enduring power and dignity of the father figure.

In America, the man leads through financial contribution, toughness, and emotional self-discipline. The father is a symbol of stability and protection — but also distance. In some cases, as with post-war veterans dealing with injury or trauma, this role was challenged by the realities of dependence, mental health struggles, and shifting expectations of what makes a “good” man [[American Masculinity]].

Understanding these differences helps me see how masculinity is not universal — it’s culturally constructed and historically shaped. Each version of masculinity reflects the values that a society wanted to promote: harmony and duty in China, independence and productivity in America. While both have strengths, both also reveal pressures that can weigh heavily on individuals trying to live up to these ideals.

### Traditional Chinese Masculinity

##### Wen and Wu Ideals

Traditional Chinese masculinity is structured by two archetypes: the scholar (wen) and the warrior (wu). Confucius is the model wen, a refined intellectual of the gentry class, while the god of war Guan Yu embodies _wu_, which is associated with physical prowess and the lower classes. The ideal man is though of not to be either Confucius or Guan Yu, but a mix of both.

>The ideal man is supposed to be someone who has both qualities. So in leadership, the emperor sits in the middle. He is not as good a fighter as a wu man, and not as good a scholar as a wen man, but he has the quality to lead both," - Kam Louie

Chinese women are typically portrayed to be attracted to wen men, who as scholars would have status and security. Wu men, on the other hand, prefer the company of other men and dislike woman because they see them as a distraction. This loyalty gives rise to 'homo-sociality' in which the men have significant emotional and physical relationships with each other.

In contrast, Western masculine icons like James Bond tend to operate by themselves and do not mind giving in to the temptations of women. Some other examples I can think of are Indiana Jones, Tony Stark, and the Doctor from Doctor Who.

Similarly, Chinese brotherhood also differs by having a strict hierarchy. For Western brotherhood relationships, it's like a roundtable where nobody is the boss and everyone is equal. In Chinese though, the hierarchal nature even shows in language. An example that Professor Kam Louie gives is that of Hong Kong crime movies, where 'dai lo' or 'lo dai' means boss, but in English saying 'older brother' doesn't have connotation of someone above you.

Getting back on track, as said by professor Kam Louie, the ideal man was expected to exhibit both traits of wen and wu, showing how masculinity in China even traditionally was not all about toughness or dominance, but also wisdom and culture.

### Confucian Family Roles

##### Chinese Tradition

Confucius was a Chinese philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period, which was characterized by the gradual erosion of royal power. Confucius had and still has a great influence on Chinese culture and society. mainly for founding Confucianism. Confucianism is a system of ethical and philosophical teachers that emphasize various things among
- Moral Integrity
- Social harmony
- Respect for family and elders
- Proper conduct in relationships and society
- The importance of education and self-cultivation

In Confucianism, the roles of the husband and wife, parent and child, elder brother and younger brother are all clearly defined. A husband/father is expected to exhibit dominance and kindness to his wife in return for obedience and love, and offer guidance and protection to his children in return for respect and obedience. This put the man in the family in a position of power and authority.

Focusing more on gender roles, the family provider was the father or eldest son. He was also upheld as the ultimate decision-maker, though some families may defer to consulting their elders. In contrast to this, the mother's role was to fulfill domestic duties and care for the children. It is also common or extended family to live with the immediate family, to perhaps care for children.

More recently though, as gender equality has been embraced, many women also work and exercise authority in family matters. For example, in some metropolitan areas like Shanghai, women can be more dominant than men in the household. There is still a gender gap in politics and business though, and women are still expected to care for the children and the household.

The scenario described in the previous paragraph though, can perhaps reveal the connection between someone's monetary contribution and importance in the household. This is additionally made plausible by the fact that financial success is now a key status symbol for Chinese families. Despite this though, family authority is still heavily dependent on age, traditional roles, and cultural expectations.

Additionally, providing care to one's child is also seen as very important in a family, especially with the one-child policy being implemented, leading parents to be utterly devoted to their children's success. The point is, these dynamics arise from rather tense balance of modern values like gender equality an individual achievement, and traditional Confucian ethics, which are always evolving.

### Role of Fathers in China

##### Chinese Fatherhood Progression

The historical role of Chinese fathers was keeping with [[Confucian Family Roles]], which emphasized a father's power over his offspring. Although the text described the ideal father-child relationship of kind and filial, most related texts scarcely mentioned a fathers' obligation to provide financial support to their young children, and mention even less about fathers being involved in daily caregiving tasks.

Confucian fatherhood is based off the notion that because the parents give birth to the children, they have done something inherently good for their children, and so their children are inherently indebted to them. The debt is less transactional, and more moral and existential; the child repays with lifelong respect, obedience, and care, especially as the parents age. Some of this is still demonstrated today, as for Chinese families it is seen as shameful to send parents to an aged care facility. This will be referred to as natal debt.

Anyways, in the 19th century, Confucian father-son relationships began to be challenged, and by the 20th century, intellectuals were putting serious thought into how the country could bring about changes to fatherhood. In 1919, Lu Xun wrote the tract "What is Required to Be a Father Today," which rejected the notion of natal debt. Due to a combination of Confucian notions and imported ideas ranging form social Darwinism to eugenics, the family dynamics stayed as is.

Meanwhile though, ideas of women's liberation and a need to better the nation, women were encouraged to enter the workforce, soon occupying a double role of parenting and working. Due to the nature of parenting though, women were given safer jobs as well as maternity leave. This was partially responsible for workers looking down on women; employers preferred men who were denied rights like paid paternity leave and exempted from daily childcare responsibilities.

This created a sort of self sustaining loop between gender roles and the pay gap. Because of gender roles, primarily women cared for children. Because of this, they got maternity leave and mostly only worked safe jobs. Because of this, employers disliked women for being more expensive to hire (due to maternity leave), giving them less opportunities or paying them less. Because of this, men became the main breadwinners in the house, and spent less time caring for children. Because of this .... and so on.

Some positive portrayals of active fathers have emerged though, one example of which is the 2013 reality show "Dad, Where Are We Going?" where five fathers take their children to a rural village and are given challenges to improve their relationships.

### American Fatherhood

##### Fatherhood in America Has Changed

Fatherhood in America started out in the 19th century as making some money or something, and teaching their children religious piety, good work habits, and the knowledge needed to succeed in a mostly agrarian economy. This means like farming and stuff. After the Civil War though, things began to change. The growth the the US commercial economy made it more common for fathers to work at jobs outside the home, rather than a farm or family business. In addition to this, children also started to be seen as individuals with rights instead of just another pair of hands.

These changes added to the responsibility of fathers, to include providing economically for their family, and guiding their children to find jobs of their own. This change also made the authority of working class and especially immigrant fathers more vulnerable, due to the unpredictable nature of industrial work. For immigrant fathers, their children assimilated more quickly into American culture, challenging their traditional role as the primary guide and authority figure.

By the 20th century, bread-winning had become the primary characteristic of society's idea of a good American father. This responsibility is further emphasized by the industrialization of the US. The institution of the 40-hour work week, urbanization and suburbanization, and the spread of the automobile and consumer culture all contributed to this notion that fathers should earn more money.

On the other hand though, society was also realizing the importance of a father's presence for their children. American families went from having an average of six children in 1800 to three in 1900, and the growing field of child psychology demonstrated the importance of a child's adolescence stage. The New Fatherhood movement also contributed to this, where literature and social discourse promoted the idea that father should be more emotionally and physically involved in childcare.

###### Shift of Perspective

During the Great Depression, the male-dominated industrial jobs were hit much harder than the female-dominated service jobs, which led to many men feeling disempowered. During this time, Father's Day was created to restore men's dignity and public recognition, though was only put into law in 1972. 

During World War II, the situation somewhat reversed with fathers who were previously unemployed now physically absent due to military service. Griswold puts it quite elegantly,
>"[Fathers went from being] absent from work during the Depression, to absent at war," - Griswold

During the early years of the war, fathers weren't drafted which contributed to a spike in marriages as they became a draft avoiding strategy. The importance of fatherhood was also used in debates on whether they should be drafted.

What a good father is, is still an ongoing discourse that is very complex and involved. Fathers are still getting mixed messages, especially from their bosses, their institutions, and from the culture around them that they aren't trusted to be parents. It's clear that society hasn't arrived at the perfect image of a good American dad yet, but

### American Masculinity

##### American Masculinity

In the early 1940s, American society set its expectations for masculinity. In addition to courage and bravery, men strove to develop traits such as aggression, competition, stoicism, toughness, and independence in order to prove to others that they were truly masculine. This both agrees with and highlights how the Great Depression was the greatest threat to one's sense of manhood at the time because it threatened men's positions as providers.

This contrasts with World War II, where men were able to prove their masculinity through fighting for their country and what not, but this experience left many injured, or with long lasting phycological trauma. Hold onto the injured note, cause it'll be mentioned later.

When the war began and men were drafted, many industrial positions were left open which women had to fill. When the war ended though, employers expected women leave their secure, high-paying jobs to go back to their domestic duties, to make way for returning veterans. Some 678,000 of these veterans though, had injuries so severe that they couldn't provide for their families.

Popular literature during this time emphasized that women were to love and care for the physically wounded, but depending on women added to men’s feelings of inferiority.

The rest of the article is mostly about how President Harry Truman understood that for these veterans to be productive, they need psychiatric help. Thus, on July 3, 1946, signed the National Mental Health Act of 1946.

In conclusion, World War II and its consequences redefined American masculinity. While some lingering desires for strong and stoic masculinity still remain, the American public embraced a broader understanding of masculinity based in the home, workplace, family, and fatherhood.

Americans expected returning veterans to contribute to society by entering the workforce and becoming successful husbands and fathers. However, the nation first needed to address war’s physical and psychological consequences to ensure veterans fulfilled these new responsibilities.
